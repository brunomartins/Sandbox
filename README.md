# MMLib, a library of custom nodes for Grasshopper and Dynamo.
Having our own library of tools allow us:
* We can implement all the functions we need to make everyone's everyday job easier and more integrated with our workflows.
* You don't need to install multiple libraries creating problems of usabilities across teams.
* We maintain and improve it.

This is why I made it, and I hope we can expand with more tools!
