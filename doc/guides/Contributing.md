Please use **GitHub issues** for your feedback, reporting bugs or suggesting new tools.
Follow these steps on how to create an [issue.](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue)

### Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

### Making changes.
Unsure where to begin contributing to Sandbox? You can start by looking through the issues:
We use GitHub issues to track:
	* Reporting a bug
 	* Discussing the current state of the code
	* Submitting a fix
	* Proposing new features

if you are submitting a bug or suggesting an enhancement provide more information as possible.
### Bugs üêõ: 
* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
	When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.

If the issues is approved, you will be assigned to the issue.
Once you get assegned to an issue you can start coding!

### All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests.
1. **Create your branch** from `master`, it will be always the most updated.
	* This should usally branch of from master.
	* Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
	* To quickly create a topic branch based on master, run `git checkout -b dev/<initial name and surname>/<name-of-the-task>` example `dev/mibi/review-point-at`.
4. If you've added code that should be tested, **add tests**.
5. If you've changed APIs, **update the documentation**.
6. **Ensure the test suite passes**.
7. Make sure your code lints.
8. Issue that pull request!
	* In the pull request, **outline what you did and link it to the specific issue** that you are resolving. This is a tremendous help for us in evaluation and acceptance.
	* Once the pull request is in, **please do not delete the branch or close the pull request** (unless something is wrong with it).

### Respond to feedback on pull request

We may have feedback for you to fix or change some things. We generally like to see that pushed against the same topic branch (it will automatically update the Pull Request).
If we have comments or questions when we do evaluate it and receive no response, it will probably lessen the chance of getting accepted. Eventually, this means it will be closed if it is not accepted. Please know this doesn't mean we don't value your contribution, just that things go stale. If in the future you want to pick it back up, feel free to address our concerns/questions/feedback and reopen the issue/open a new PR (referencing old one).
