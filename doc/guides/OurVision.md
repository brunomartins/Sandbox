## Why develop Sandbox?
Right across Mott MacDonald, many teams and individuals are creating and developing custom tools and workflows for Grasshopper, Dynamo and Revit!<br/>
This is amazing - however - we often notice the tools are not being collected, shared and re-used across the business. <br/>
Many times these tools are used once only, or remain silent on the creators hard drive.

We believe that Sandbox is a springboard to create an internal community of developers and users, who can leverage a mindset of automation and computational thinking, plus accelerate their own learning and growth with computational design. <br/>

**Sandbox wants to increase re-usability.** <br/>
So whilst we want to promote sharing, we also believe unification is important – otherwise we won’t have the opportunity to meaningfully reduce overheads, control spending and duplication. <br/>
Sandbox enables and increases re-useability and continuous improvement of custom tools and workflows.

## Why is Sandbox a product?
**Sandbox is a tech development, and as such it needs to be maintained and continually evaluated.**<br/>
In the first instance, Sandbox will be grown via implementations, usage, feature requests, bug fixing, and maintenance. <br/>
Following this, some powerful benefits of the platform can be realised:  Analytical data can be extracted and used to evaluate the effectiveness and usablity.

So of course everyone wants to be more efficient and save time, but time is only one piece of the puzzle! <br/>
**Sandbox also brings other values.** It gives us a great opportunity to prioritise developments, be more effecting on projects and choose the best direction for building our own tools and automations. 

## What benefits can Sandbox bring?

## Think about: 
- Building a community of developers, gathered around a centralised and managed library.
- Continuously improving the discoverability and usability of the library.
- Improving knowledge sharing, both of the library and also the workflows.
- Sharing and teaching different ways of thinking!  Computational mindsets and ways of thinking around tools.

## Sandbox can't be built overnight.
* **Changes don't happen simply via adoptions of tools within Sandbox**, but by having people push the correct utilisation, and inspiring other teams to embrace the digitalisation process.
* **You don't need to know how to code to be involved!** Sandbox grows not only from developing content, but by people bringing ideas and solutions that can be developed to help with their daily work.  So whilst you need a coder responsible for the implementation, you also really need users to have the ideas, and turn the workflows into 
something meaningful.
* **Sandbox is a ramp:** to create an internal community and leverage the right mindset about automation & computational design, accelerate adoption, sharing and learning.
