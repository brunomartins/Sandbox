## Why we developed Sandbox?
Many teams across all the organization have developed custom tools for Grasshopper and Dynamo in the past years, none of them are collected / shared and re-used across the business, most of the time these tools are used internally / silently in the teams.<br/>
**Sandbox wants to increase re-usability.** <br/>
If we only promote sharing but not unification – we don’t have the opportunity to meaningfully reduce overheads and limit spending and duplication.

## Why Sandbox is a product and a service?
**Sandbox is a tech development, and as such need to be maintained and evaluated.**<br/>
The first through implementations, new features and bug fixings.<br/>
The second via analytic, to evaluate efficient but also how much the tools effect the works.<br/>
We always look to how much time we save, but we are only seeing one part of the puzzle, be more efficient is one way to be more effective but it is not the only way.
Setting the goal to be more effecting on the overall jobs, is where we can really prioritize what to do, when and how with our tools and automatons.

**Sandbox like a service.**<br/>
Sandbox provides different type of tools that people can mix and match, to become some other applications / workflows.<br/>
Sandbox could connect to external services (is actually connecting to GitHub), for example we could develop connectors to Moata and use the its services.

## What are the benefits Sandbox can bring?

## Sandbox can't be built overnight
the change doesn't happen only via the adoptions of tools, but having people pushing the correct utilization and inspiring other teams to embrace the digitalisation process.

Sandbox grows not only by people developing the nodes, but by people bringing ideas and solutions that can be developed to help them day by day works.

Sandbox is the ramp to create an internal community to leverage the good mindset about automation / computational and acceleration their adoption and learning.
