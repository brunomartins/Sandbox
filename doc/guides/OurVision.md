## Why we developed Sandbox?
Many teams across all the organization have developed custom tools for Grasshopper and Dynamo in the past years, none of them are collected / shared and re-used across the business, most of the time these tools are used internally / silently in the teams.<br/>
**Sandbox wants to increase re-usability.** <br/>
If we only promote sharing but not unification – we don’t have the opportunity to meaningfully reduce overheads and limit spending and duplication.

## Why Sandbox is a product?
**Sandbox is a tech development, and as such need to be maintained and evaluated.**<br/>
1. The first through implementations, new features and bug fixings.
2. The second via analytic, to **evaluate efficient but also how much the tools effect the works.**
We always look to how much time we save, but we are only seeing one part of the puzzle, be more efficient is one way to be more effective but it is not the only way.
Setting the goal to be more effecting on the overall jobs, is where we can really prioritize what to do, when and how with our tools and automatons.

## What are the benefits Sandbox can bring?

## How we can achieve this?
- Building a community of developers around the library
- Improving knowledge sharing of the library and workflows
- Sharing and teaching different ways of thinking and looking to tools
- Keeping improving discoverability and usability of the library

## Sandbox can't be built overnight
* **Changes doesn't happen only via the adoptions of tools**, but having people pushing the correct utilization and inspiring other teams to embrace the digitalisation process.
* **Sandbox grows not only by people developing the nodes, but by people bringing ideas** and solutions that can be developed to help them day by day works.
The two roles: the workflow coder and the user are two essential parts. While the coder takes the responsibility of encoding, the user is the one who compose the workflows in something meaningful.
* **Sandbox is the ramp** to create an internal community to leverage the good mindset about automation / computational and acceleration their adoption and learning.
